subid,unique subject identifier,character,N/A,each value represents an individual subject,
slidenumber,original slide number,numeric,3-20; 24-41,N/A,this is the actual slide number representing the order at which subjects viewed the slides as they advanced through the slideshows; first and last slides from each run through the slideshow are excluded
condition,indicates which slideshow the participant viewed,character,barrier; nothing; straight,barrier - actor reaching over a barrier for a ball; nothing - actor reaching up and over in the absence of a barrier for a ball; straight - actor reaching straight for a ball,
rawDT,participants' raw dwell time values (generated by matlab) for each slide,numeric,N/A,N/A,dwell times indicate how long participants were looking at each slide
age_months,participants' age in months,numeric,N/A,N/A,
milliDT,dwell times converted to milliseconds,numeric,N/A,N/A,
logDT,dwell times log transformed,numeric,N/A,N/A,
logDT_win,dwell times winsorised,numeric,N/A,N/A,dwell times with outlying values replaced with value representing three SD above the overall mean
slide_num_adj,adjusted slide number,numeric,2-19,N/A,"slideshows were repeated twice, this value represents the slide number within the slideshow for each repetition.  first (slide #1) and last (slide #20) slides have been removed as is consistent with typical methods of analyzing dwell time data "
run,"run through the same slideshow (i.e., viewing number)",character,first; second,first - first run through a slideshow; second - second run through a slideshow,
slide_type,"indicates whether a given slide represents a boundary or is not a boundary (i.e., within-unit slide)",character,boundary; within,boundary - indicates that a slide corresponds to an event boundary; within - indicates that a slide does not correspond to an event boundry (or that it corresponds to a within-unit region of action),
pix_change,degree of pixel change from the previous slide,numeric,N/A,N/A,these values are quite large as pixel change is summed across all pixels in the image
pix_adj,pixel change divided by the total number of pixels in the image,numeric,N/A,N/A,"these values represent the pixel change adjusted by the total number of pixels in each image (i.e., image size is 599x960 pixels, so pixel value was divided by 575,040)"
